    <!-- VLAN ID 1 is the default VLAN and before scale vlan can be configured
         all ports will be added to default VLAN 1 as untagged hence when removing ports from
         VLAN 1 it should be allowed to be deleted from VLAN 1. This VLAN is not actually a
         L3 VLAN but because of the above behavior, it makes snese to allow adding/deleting
         port to VLAN 1 in OS  -->
